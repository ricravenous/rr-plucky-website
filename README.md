# Ralph's Launch Cards

Ralph's Launch Cards is a project designed to supplement conversation by allowing the user to choose a topic, and conversation starter.

The goal of the web application is to:
  * Help ideation processes by giving users several questions to help start the conversation.
  * Be accessible via mobile devices so as to bring only a phone into a board meeting to use the app.
  * Show off some fun additional branding potential of thoughtbot's mascot, Ralph.
